# SBR-TCG
Mathematica notebook created to analyze Sampling Best Response (SBR) dynamics in 3-strategy Tacit Coordination Games (TCG)

This software was used to create several figures in the paper titled "Stability of strict Nash equilibria under sampling best response dynamics", by [Segismundo S. Izquierdo](http://www.segis.izqui.org) & [Luis R. Izquierdo](http://www.luis.izqui.org).
